# Motivation

This software has been created in order to help solving problems which are typically arising when developing complex UI software using the Qt/QML framework. This kind of system is usually designed in such a way that some C++ code exposes functionality to the QML engine. The typical challenges are the following:
 - The complexity of the code written in QML/JS tends to increase, which results in both maintenance and performance issues.
 - Exposing C++ interfaces to the QML engine requires writing pretty large portions of boilerplate code, which typically results in inconsistencies in a project involving a large number of developers if this boilerplate code is written by hand.
 - Interfaces exposed to the code written in QML/JS code are typically spread over a large number of C++ classes.
 - Testing the code written in QML/JS code independently from the rest of the system is hard because of its hard dependency to the code written in C++.
 - Exposing some of the interfaces on an IPC requires additional adaptation code.

# Requirements

This is a list of requirements which have been taken into account when designing this component:
 - Interfaces are defined using the QFace IDL. Using an IDL ensures that the exposed interface is the same, regardless of the language used to implement the interface.
 - Interfaces can be implemented in C++
 - Interfaces can be implemented in QML/JS
 - C++ interface implementations should be clean from any hack required by the interfacing to QML (no wrapping of data into QVariant, no need to implement a QAbstractItemModel, no use of integer instead of enum, etc...)
 - The interface exposed to the UI code should be completely defined using the IDL. Interface implementation details should not be visible to the UI code. Exceptions to that rule should be easily identifiable.
 - The framework should be able to produce proxy and adapter classes which enable an interface implementation to be accessible via an IPC channel.
 - A proxy class should implement the exact same interface as the object implementing the actual interface.
 - Proxy classes should be usable from both C++ and from QML code.
 - Proxy classes should use direct calls when the server object happens to be running in the same process as the proxy.

# FaceLift

Project folder structure:
 - lib : contains the C++ library which the generated code relies on
 - generator : contains the code generator based on the qface framework
 - qface : contains the qface framework (IDL parser, code generation frontend)
 - examples : contains example applications
     - AddressBook
         - interface : contains the interface definition of the model
         - models : contains various implementations of the model interfaces
         - ui : contains the UI code of the application

# Dependencies

* Cmake >= 3.1
* Python 3 (for qface)
* Qt >= 5.5
* Antlr4 python3 runtime

# Ubuntu/Debian
The required packages can be installed using the following commands:
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-click python3-path python3-pip python3-jinja2 python3-yaml cmake qtdeclarative5-dev qml-module-qtquick-controls qtdeclarative5-private-dev
```

In addition, since no deb package is available for it, you need to install the antlr4 runtime using the following command line (for example):
```
$ pip3 install antlr4-python3-runtime
```

# MacOS/brew
```
$ brew install qt5 python3
$ pip3 install antlr4-python3-runtime six pyyaml click typing jinja2 watchdog path.py
```

# Build

We use QFace as a submodule, which you need to fetch using the following command line:
```
$ git submodule init && git submodule update
```

You are now ready to build the package using the following commands:
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. && make
```

If you want to build using your own version of Qt, you can specify its location using the following command instead:
```
$ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt/gcc_64/lib/cmake .. && make
```

CCACHE can greatly improve build time in some situations. Configure the project with the following command to enable CCACHE:
```
$ CC="ccache gcc" CXX="ccache g++" cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt/gcc_64/lib/cmake .. && make
```

# Examples

Multiple example applications are provided, which can be built together with the package itself using the `-DFACELIFT_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON` CMake configure option.

Each example has a corresponding launch script which you can use to start the example.

For example:
```
$ ./examples/launch-addressbook.sh
```
