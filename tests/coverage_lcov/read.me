# The LLVM-COV -- is a tool shows code coverage information for programs that are instrumented to emit profile data.
 The 'llvm-cov gcov' tool reads code coverage data files and displays
 the coverage information for a specified source file.
 It is compatible with the GCOV tool from version 4.2 of GCC and may also be compatible with some later versions of GCOV.

# The GCOV -- is a source code coverage analysis and statement-by-statement profiling tool.
 Gcov generates exact counts of the number of times each statement in a program is executed and annotates source code to add instrumentation.
 Provides the following details:
 - How often each line of code executes
 - What lines of code are actually executed
 - How much computing time each section of code uses

# The LCOV -- is a graphical front-end for GCC's coverage testing tool GCOV.
 It collects gcov data for multiple source files and creates HTML pages containing the source code annotated with coverage information.
 It also adds overview pages for easy navigation within the file structure. LCOV supports statement, function and branch coverage measurement.

# source code:
 LCOV:     http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php
 LLVM-COV: git clone http://llvm.org/git/llvm.git

# install using apt-get:
 LLVM-COV: when installing using apt-get install llvm-<NUMBER>, llvm-cov will be installed with a suffix of the version number as well.
 $ apt-get install llvm-<NUMBER>
 LCOV:
 $ apt-get install lcov

# CAUTION: Create a wrapper script (patch) for LCOV
 LLVM has a fast development speed, thus the llvm-cov command line options have been changed, and lcov can no longer recognize it.
 Thus, we have to create a script llvm-gcov.sh to workaround the problem:

 #!/bin/bash
 exec llvm-cov gcov "$@"
 $ chmod +x llvm-gcov.sh

# How to use
 Run script:
   ~/facelift/build$ tests/coverage_lcov/test_lcov.sh
 Results of coverage will be available in the folder
   ~/facelift/build$ lcov/report_lcov_yy-mm-dd-hms
